USAID,3/1/2025,"WEST AFRICA BLUE (“BLUE”)’S PROJECTS ARE DEDICATED TO THE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF MANGROVE ECOSYSTEMS THROUGHOUT WEST AFRICA, WITH A FOCUS ON GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE. THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PROTECT CRITICAL BIODIVERSITY, AND ENHANCE THE LIVELIHOODS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BLUE’S FIRST PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AS A PIPELINE LISTING ON VERRA’S VERIFIED CARBON STANDARDS (VCS) REGISTRY IN AUGUST 2023 AND CAN BE FOUND HERE. GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND COUNTRIES’ CONTEXT: ACCORDING TO THE USAID - FOREST CARBON, MARKETS AND COMMUNITIES (FCMC) PROJECT, MANGROVES IN WEST AFRICA REPRESENT 13% OF MANGROVE FORESTS WORLDWIDE AND COVER MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION HECTARES ACROSS 19 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE REGION HAS EXPERIENCED A RAPID LOSS OF ITS MANGROVE COVER AT A RATE OF 1.7% PER YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN WEST AFRICA FACE HIGH POVERTY LEVELS, INEQUALITY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR FACE INCREASED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY. BLUE’S PROJECT AREAS ARE HOME TO TRADITIONAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TURNED TO MANGROVE CUTTING AS A WAY TO MAKE INCOME DUE TO DEPLETED FISH STOCKS FROM FOREIGN TRAWLERS. MANGROVE FORESTS IN SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA ARE BEING DEFORESTED DUE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS SELLING MANGROVE WOOD OR USING IT FOR PRESERVING FISH THROUGH SMOKING, FUEL FOR COOKING, CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, OR OTHER USES. FURTHER, MANGROVES PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE AS NURSERY AREAS FOR FISH AND SHELLFISH, WHICH CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $400 MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. MANGROVE FORESTS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR STABILIZING THE SHORELINE AND BUFFERING COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE. GUINEA GUINEA’S CONTINENTAL SHELF EXTENDS 300 KM, COVERING A 47,400 KM2 AREA DOTTED BY INLETS, TIDAL MARSHES, ESTUARIES, AND NUMEROUS OFFSHORE ISLANDS. MANGROVE AREAS, WHICH EXTEND ALONG MOST OF THE COAST AND UP TO 40 KM INLAND, REMAIN LARGE AND BIODIVERSE, BUT HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN 30% SINCE THE EARLY 1980S. A 2019 SURVEY BY NASA ESTIMATES TOTAL MANGROVE COVER AT 2,076 KM2, OF WHICH ONLY 1,000 KM2 CAN BE UTILIZED FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.¹ THE GUINEAN MANGROVES ARE A COASTAL ECOREGION OF MANGROVE SWAMPS IN RIVERS AND ESTUARIES NEAR THE SHORELINE OF WEST AFRICA FROM SENEGAL TO SIERRA LEONE AND ARE HOME TO OVER 500 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED AND/OR VULNERABLE SPECIES ON THE IUCN RED LIST.

THE PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT 60 % OF BENEFICIARIES ARE AGYW. IT WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OVCA&Y AND THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1 (HEALTHY): THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE OVCA&Y ACCESS TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND HIV CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES THROUGH RELATED SMALL GROUP EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FACILITATING ACCESS TO HTS (OFFERED DIRECTLY AT HOME AND THROUGH PARTNER FACILITIES) AND SUCCESSFUL LINKAGES TO ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY, CONTRACEPTIVES AND OTHER HEALTH SERVICES. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT TO INFECTED, BEREAVED OVCA&Y OR VICTIMS OF ABUSE. OBJECTIVE 2 (SAFE): THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE CHILD PROTECTION AND PREVENTION OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) THROUGH DIRECT SUPPORT TO OVCA&Y, THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS AND THE COMMUNITY. CINDI WILL PROVIDE CHILD PROTECTION EDUCATION AND PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING FOR CAREGIVERS, AND TRAINED PROJECT PERSONNEL WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND INITIATE REMOVAL OF CHILDREN FROM ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS. OBJECTIVE 3 (STABLE): THE THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC SECURITY AND LINKAGE TO SOCIAL PROTECTION THROUGH PROVISION OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO BOTH OVCA&Y AND THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS. CINDI WILL PREPARE ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH FOR SELF-EMPLOYMENT OR THE JOB MARKET THROUGH FINANCIAL CAPABILITY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND EMPLOYABILITY TRAINING (ASPIRES).

CINDI WILL DO THIS THROUGH THE PROVISION OF HOMEWORK SUPPORT AND TUITION CLUBS TO IDENTIFIED LEARNERS, PROVISION OF SCHOOL UNIFORMS, STATIONERY AND DISTRIBUTION OF SANITARY PADS TO MINIMIZE ABSENTEEISM.
